Seismic stations around the world generate huge amounts of data every day that needs to be collected and analysed manually, which requires a large number of analysts with knowledge of seismology. Developing models that can automatically analyse seismic data can help improve the efficiency of seismic data processing. The objective of this paper is to propose an automated system for the recognition and classification of seismic signals by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and to verify the performance of the model through experiments. The experiments are divided into two stages. Firstly, four different synthetic waveform data were used as input to the model and the experiments achieved an accuracy of at least 75% for the classification of high and low frequency waveforms. Secondly, using historical seismic signal sequences as input, the seismic traces were equally divided and labelled into two segments and fed into this 1D convolutional neural network to achieve a 90% classification accuracy. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network with overlapping sliding windows was used to obtain 95% accuracy. The results of both phases of the experiments show that this 1D convolutional neural network model has good classification capability. However, it is only applicable to a similar volume of data, and processing more data requires a deeper network and a more accurate dataset.
